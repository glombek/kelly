            About Kelly
        </h2>
        <p>
            Always had an interest in computers since the age of 4 (yes, my parents decided to sit me on the computer from this age), and I learned a great deal from it, and because of I was the quickest to learn to read and write and became top of my classes. I also had a knack of trying to copy my dad at 6 to create a web page, and yes I learned HTML on my own at about 8.
</p><p>
Not going to lie, I slacked in secondary school, especially sixth form and I am just incredibly lucky that I got a software development apprenticeship which I thoroughly enjoy. I always wanted to go into development ever since I started with HTML and then later decided I wanted to go into Computing (and learned Python, which is rubbish but it spouted something beautiful). I also learned PHP.
</p><p>
Also pretty good at putting ideas across, created an idea at a Microsoft day where Big Ambitions asked us to design a product and all that jazz then present it. My idea won, pretty proud of that, but why did I get an iPod from Microsoft?
</p><p>
Lifes mysteries are just so large.
</p><p>
Now I have achieved my City and Guilds certificate for software development and have been in software development for 2 years.
</p><p>
Specialties: C# (in training), PHP (although limited these days), design, sales, customer services, personal skills, communication
